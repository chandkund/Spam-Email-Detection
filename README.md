# Spam-Email-Detection
This project focuses on detecting spam emails using a fine-tuned DistilBERT model, a lighter version of the BERT model. The model is trained to classify email text into two categories: spam (1) and not spam (0). The dataset consists of email texts labeled as either spam or non-spam.
